Project: This project is the portfolio tasks for data science/data analysis, which consists of three tasks:

- First Portfolio: 
    * Dataset Description: The datasets used in this task is about cycling, with some relevant fields (variables) such as speed, distance, etc. The most 
                    noticeable fields would be cadence which would be used to calculate the development (gear usage element).
    * Task Description: The task is divided into four questions, and a challenge task to be explored. The four questions are mostly about exploring the
                    datasets (fundamental of data science) and doing comparison between dataframes. The challenge task is for calculating the
                    distance travelled with one revolution on the pedals from cadence and speed given in the dataset, then plotting the histogram.
- Second Portfolio:
    * Dataset Description: The datasets used in this task is about the sport vouchers program held in two Australian States: South Australia and 
                    Queensland. Also, the Australian SEIFA census dataset is provided so that I can explore any relationship of the variables in 
                    these distinct datasets.
    * Task Description: The task is divided into four questions, and a challenge task. The four questions are mostly about visualising the large dataframe
                    to summarise the main (standout) features, and exploring the fields in the sport voucher program (South Australia) dataset
                    with the fields in the SEIFA dataset to study their relationship. The challenge task is for exploring the voucher dataset
                    (Queensland), doing some general data analysis (cleaning, summary, visualisation, and exploring) to compare with the South
                    Australia dataset.
- Third Portfolio:
    * Dataset Description: The datasets used in this task is about the mobile customer churn (customer leaving the mobile service) provided by Optus.
    * Task Description: The task asks to build a classification model to predict the customer churn. The model is built based on Logistic Regression. I
                    firstly only include those numerical fields in the dataset to the model, since the Logistic Regression can only fit numerical
                    fields as input. Then, I build another model to convert some relevant categorical fields into dummies and add them as input
                    to the model of prediction.
